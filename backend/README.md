# AudioMuse Backend — Read-Only Knowledge API

A deterministic read-only HTTP projection of the canonical AudioMuse repository.

**The repository remains the source of truth.** This service reads the corpus once at
startup, validates what it read, indexes it in memory, and serves JSON. It performs no
runtime writes of any kind.

`docs/backend-architecture.md` holds the full projection chain and the rationale behind
each architectural decision. This file is the operator's guide.

## Directory structure

```text
backend/
├── cmd/audiomuse-api/          process entry point, startup logging, graceful shutdown
├── internal/
│   ├── config/                 repository root and listen address resolution
│   ├── domain/                 typed AudioMuse records; no I/O, no HTTP
│   ├── repository/             KnowledgeRepository — a read-only interface with no write method
│   │   └── filesystem/         the only package that touches the corpus
│   ├── service/                immutable startup index, filtering, search, graph projection
│   ├── httpapi/                routing, query bounds, JSON envelopes, method lock
│   └── testsupport/            fixture corpus loading for tests
├── testdata/corpus/            synthetic fixture corpus (not canonical knowledge)
└── go.mod
```

Dependencies point one way and filesystem parsing never happens in an HTTP handler:

```text
httpapi  →  service  →  repository (interface)  →  repository/filesystem  →  canonical repository
```

The only external dependency is `gopkg.in/yaml.v3`, because the corpus is YAML and regex
parsing of structured records is exactly the brittleness this backend exists to replace.

## Running locally

From `backend/`:

```powershell
go version
```

```powershell
go mod tidy
```

```powershell
go vet ./...
```

```powershell
go test ./...
```

```powershell
go build ./...
```

Run the API. With no configuration it discovers the repository root by walking up from the
working directory, so this works from anywhere inside the repo:

```powershell
go run ./cmd/audiomuse-api
```

Point it at a specific repository with an environment variable:

```powershell
$env:AUDIOMUSE_REPO_ROOT = "C:\Users\britb\Documents\audiomuse"; go run ./cmd/audiomuse-api
```

Or with flags, which take precedence over the environment:

```powershell
go run ./cmd/audiomuse-api -repo-root C:\Users\britb\Documents\audiomuse -addr 127.0.0.1:8788
```

### Configuration

| Setting | Flag | Environment | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Repository root | `-repo-root` | `AUDIOMUSE_REPO_ROOT` | discovered upward from the working directory |
| Listen address | `-addr` | `AUDIOMUSE_ADDR` | `127.0.0.1:8788` |

Precedence is flag, then environment, then discovery. The root must contain `nodes/`,
`schemas/node.schema.yaml`, `schemas/relationship-types.yaml` and
`sources/source-registry.yaml`, or startup fails with a clear message. Discovery walks only
from the working directory to the filesystem root and never inspects a sibling tree.

The default address binds loopback: a knowledge corpus should not become reachable from the
network by accident.

### Startup output

```text
level=INFO msg="AudioMuse API" mode=read-only repository=... nodes=78 sessions=3
  sources=51 edges=220 validation=WARN warnings=1 listen=127.0.0.1:8788
```

`validation` is `PASS`, `WARN` or `FAIL`. A `FAIL` aborts startup and prints every fatal
issue. The absolute repository path appears here, in the operator's terminal, and in no HTTP
response.

## API

Base path `/api/v1`. Every response is JSON.

| Method | Route | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/health` | process liveness; does not touch the corpus |
| GET | `/api/v1/project` | corpus summary, counts, domains, statuses, validation status |
| GET | `/api/v1/nodes` | node summaries, filtered, searched and paged |
| GET | `/api/v1/nodes/{id}` | one full node with its derived inbound relationships |
| GET | `/api/v1/sessions` | session summaries with their derived node contribution lists |
| GET | `/api/v1/sessions/{id}` | one session |
| GET | `/api/v1/graph` | the full read-only graph projection |
| GET | `/api/v1/diagnostics` | sanitized validation warnings |

### Node query parameters

| Parameter | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `q` | lexical substring search, case-insensitive, over id, title, domain, status, definition and core_concepts |
| `domain` | exact canonical domain |
| `status` | exact canonical status |
| `session` | exact registered session ID appearing in `session_origin` |
| `limit` | page size; default 50, clamped to 200 |
| `offset` | page start; default 0 |

`/api/v1/sessions` accepts `q`, `limit` and `offset`.

Canonical filters (`domain`, `status`, `session`) match exactly and case-sensitively,
following the canonical identity semantics in `docs/knowledge-model.md`. Only `q` is
tolerant. An unrecognised query parameter is refused with `400 invalid_query` rather than
ignored, so a caller is never handed a result set that silently dropped their filter.

### Errors

```json
{ "error": { "code": "node_not_found", "message": "Node was not found." } }
```

Codes: `not_found`, `node_not_found`, `session_not_found`, `invalid_query`,
`method_not_allowed`, `internal_error`. Go errors, stack traces and filesystem paths are
logged locally and never serialised into a response.

### Read-only enforcement

Only `GET` and `HEAD` are accepted, anywhere. Every other method returns `405` with
`Allow: GET, HEAD`, refused by middleware that runs before routing:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Method POST http://127.0.0.1:8788/api/v1/nodes
```

## Smoke test

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod http://127.0.0.1:8788/health
```

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod http://127.0.0.1:8788/api/v1/project
```

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod "http://127.0.0.1:8788/api/v1/nodes?q=sound&limit=5"
```

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod http://127.0.0.1:8788/api/v1/nodes/sound
```

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod http://127.0.0.1:8788/api/v1/sessions
```

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod http://127.0.0.1:8788/api/v1/graph
```

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod http://127.0.0.1:8788/api/v1/diagnostics
```

## Validation

Startup separates two different failures. Fatal issues abort the process because the
projection would be wrong or ambiguous: malformed front matter, unparseable YAML, missing or
invalid ID, duplicate canonical ID, missing or unknown top-level field, unresolved
relationship target, relationship type outside the canonical vocabulary, self-link,
duplicate `(type, target)` pair, unresolved `session_origin` or `sources` reference, unsafe
path. Warnings are served on `/api/v1/diagnostics` and do not stop startup: a registered
locator that does not exist, a registered session with no directory, and registered sources
or sessions that no node cites.

The backend never repairs a record and never writes to the corpus. Canonical
inconsistencies are reported for a human to decide about.

## Tests

`go test ./...` covers the front-matter parser, the filesystem adapter and every validation
defect, the service index, filtering, search, paging and graph projection, and the HTTP
routes including 404, 400 and 405 behaviour. Unit tests run against `testdata/corpus/`, a
small synthetic fixture, so a canonical content change cannot silently move a unit-test
expectation.

Two tests run against the real repository on purpose: one asserts it loads with no fatal
issues, and one snapshots the size and modification time of every canonical file before and
after a load to assert nothing was written. Both skip if the canonical repository is not
found above the working directory.

## Known limitations

- Repository changes require a process restart. There is no watcher, no background sync and
  no filesystem polling, so a running process always serves one consistent snapshot.
- Search is lexical substring matching with no ranking. There is no semantic retrieval and
  no embedding.
- No persistence and no database; the startup index is the only state.
- Claims, experiments, experiment runs and vocabulary are canonical layers this phase does
  not parse or serve. Node `experiments:` references are therefore carried through
  unvalidated.
- No frontend, no graph visualization, and no LLM integration.

## Future work

Deferred, not implemented: a sources/claims/provenance read API, richer diagnostics, search
hardening, graph visualization, semantic retrieval, and MLLM experimentation.
